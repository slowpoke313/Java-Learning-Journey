Ternary operator: (to use if else in the same line)

?:

condition ? (if true then it will print this part) : (if false then it will print this part)

see pic for better explanation.

Switch statement: (to avoid using else if repeatedly)

int variable
switch(variable)
{
	case 1:
		code
		break;
	case 2:
		code
		break;
	case 3:
		code
		break;
	  |
	  |
	default:
		code
}

We need the break statement because if break is not used the code will execute all the cases from the matched case.

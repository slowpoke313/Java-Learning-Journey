***Difference between function and method:
Method is called through object of class, 
but function is called directly.

Methods are of two kinds:
1. Built in method
2. User define method

Method declaration:

[accessModifier] [methodType] [returnType] [methodName] (parameters)
{
	body of the method
}

accessModifier: access Modifier is the keyword that defines the accessibility of that class and its members.
Ex: public, private

methodType: method type is the keyword to define what type of method it would be. 
Ex: static, instance, abstract, factory

returnType: return type is what type of output we will be getting from that method. 
Ex: void(used for no output), int, string, double

methodName: its just the name of the method.

parameters: parameters act as variables inside the method.
